# The Program
The folder, in which this `README.md` is located in, contains the source code and the build and configuration files for a C program. 

The program introduces the `dx_log` and function which can be used to write log information.
The program emits `Hello, World!\n` to the standard output.
Furthermore, it emits information on its startup and shutdown.
If no error occurs, it terminates with success. Otherwise it terminates with failure.
