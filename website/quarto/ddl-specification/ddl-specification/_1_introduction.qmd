# Introduction
This document is the manual for version 1 of the *Data Definition Language* (*DDL*)
which is a data representation language that uses human-readable text to store  and
transmit data objects consisting of aggregate values (maps and lists) as well    as
scalar values (boolean, number, string, void).

The language is inspired by "JSON" (see [ECMA-404: The JSON data interchange syntax,2nd edition, December 2017](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/)
for more information), however, it is neither designed as a super- or subset of JSON.
